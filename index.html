      <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society,
        transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart
        of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at Data Insight Group we believe
        that government should be transparent.</p>
      <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business
        and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency
        allows good and just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information
        for citizens about what their Government is doing.</p>
      <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the
        Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely
        dispersed in society, and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed
        knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become actively engaged in American government.</p>
      <p>Data Insight Group works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and
        use. We solicit public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

      <div class="accordion-body"> In the West, the idea that government should be open to
        public scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least to the time of
        the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine of
        state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal
        legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for
        example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free
        press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This
        approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent
        historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.</div>
      <div class="accordion-body"> Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in
        America (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions and
        requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of the press in
        constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean
        statesmen to row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of
        eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the
        latter.</div>
      <div class="accordion-body"> Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of
        contemporary democratic practice and is often linked to the passing of freedom of
        information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to have adopted the first
        freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to
        the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after
        gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in
        1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).</div>
      <div class="accordion-body"> The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act
        (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were
        passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</div>
